# SkyBlock
Minimalist SkyBlock plugin for Spigot-based Minecraft servers

![](https://github.com/gekkedev/skyblock/blob/master/img/4.png)

## Installation
1. Download [this JAR file](https://github.com/gekkedev/skyblock/releases/latest) or compile it by yourself.
2. Place the file in your server's plugins directory (using `/reload` is not recommendable).
3. If your server is running, shut it down.
4. Launch your server as usual (or just use `/restart`).

## Usage
Enter `/skyblock` or just `/sb` to start playing SkyBlock and `/spawn` (an additional plugin is required for this).  
In case you ever mess up, you can reset your island by entering `/skyblock reset` or just `/sb reset` and the SkyBlock island will be recreated.

## Compatibility
The plugin is intended to run on Spigot 1.13.2 or higher.

### Resources

Each chest contains a bucket of lava, one block of ice, a piece of sugar cane, and three seeds. But that's not it! The island is made of a limited amount of sand and comes with the chance to contain a few iron ores.  

### MotD

If the plugin is installed, it appends itself to the *Message of the Day* that people will see when pinging the server.
