# SkyBlock
Minimalist SkyBlock plugin for Spigot-based Minecraft servers

## Installation
1. Download [this JAR file](https://github.com/gekkedev/skyblock/releases/latest) or compile it by yourself.
2. Place the file in your server's plugins directory (using `/reload` is not recommendable).

## Usage
Enter `/skyblock` or just `/sb` to start playing SkyBlock and `/spawn` (an additional plugin is required for this).  
In case you ever mess up, you can reset your island by entering `/skyblock reset` or just `/sb reset` and the SkyBlock island will be recreated.

## Compatibility
The plugin is intended to run on Spigot 1.13.2 or higher.
